## Author, Actor, and Movie CRUD API

This repository showcases a full-stack application to manage Author, Actor, and Movie information using GraphQL, Nest.js, and PostgreSQL.

### The application is built with the following technologies:

- Nest.js: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable, and enterprise-grade server-side applications
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that scales large codebases with ease
- Sequelize: An ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library for Node.js that supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MSSQL
- GraphQL: A query language for APIs that provides a more efficient and flexible alternative to REST
- Passport.js: An authentication middleware for Node.js that supports several strategies for authenticating users
- JWT: A JSON Web Token (JWT) library for handling JSON Web Tokens in Node.js
- Jest: A JavaScript testing framework for unit testing the application

### The application also includes the following features:

- User authentication with passport.js and JWT
- Unit testing with Jest
- GraphiQL, a visual interface for executing GraphQL queries and mutations
- Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) using Github Actions to run the unit tests and deploy the application to Heroku
- JWT
- Docker
- Kubernetes
